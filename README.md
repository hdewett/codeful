# Codeful

A nifty journalling app where users can track their progress in different coding languages through daily entries.

Users have access to a dashboard that shows their five most journal entries. Users also have the ability to view statistics on their journalling such as total words typed, the language most frequently used, and more! With the option to make their entries either public or private, users are able to share and read their friend's entries as well.
